## 🎯 How It Works

### Calculation Flow
```
1. User analyzes webpage
   ↓
2. Resources fetched and analyzed
   ↓
3. calculatePerformanceScore() runs
   ↓
4. Individual metrics calculated:
   - Page size score
   - Request count score
   - Resource distribution score
   - Compression score
   ↓
5. Weighted average computed
   ↓
6. Score displayed with visual indicator
```

### Scoring Formula
```javascript
totalScore = 
  (pageSize * 0.30) +
  (requestCount * 0.25) +
  (resourceDistribution * 0.25) +
  (compression * 0.20)
```

## 🎨 Visual Features

### Score Circle
- Large, prominent circular indicator
- Gradient background matching score category
- Animated border effect
- Clear number display (0-100)
- Category label below

### Breakdown Section
- Toggles on info button click
- Shows all 4 metric scores
- Displays key metrics:
  - Total page size in MB
  - Total request count
  - Number of large files
- Clean, organized layout

### Color Coding
- **Excellent (90-100)**: Vibrant green - Best performance
- **Good (75-89)**: Bright orange - Minor improvements
- **Fair (50-74)**: Dark orange - Needs optimization
- **Poor (0-49)**: Red - Critical issues

## 📊 Metric Details

### 1. Page Size Score (30%)
**What it measures:** Total page weight in MB

**Scoring:**
- 100 pts: < 0.5 MB (excellent)
- 90-75 pts: 0.5-1 MB (good)
- 75-50 pts: 1-2 MB (fair)
- 50-20 pts: 2-5 MB (poor)
- 0-20 pts: > 5 MB (very poor)

**Why it matters:** Directly impacts load time and data usage

### 2. Request Count Score (25%)
**What it measures:** Number of HTTP requests

**Scoring:**
- 100 pts: < 25 requests (excellent)
- 90-75 pts: 25-50 requests (good)
- 75-40 pts: 50-100 requests (fair)
- 40-20 pts: 100-150 requests (poor)
- 0-20 pts: > 150 requests (very poor)

**Why it matters:** Each request adds latency; fewer is better

### 3. Resource Distribution Score (25%)
**What it measures:** Balance and efficiency of resource types

**Penalties applied for:**
- Image-heavy pages (>70% of total size): -30 pts
- Excessive JavaScript (>50% of size): -25 pts
- Too much CSS (>30% of size): -15 pts
- Large individual files (>500KB each): -5 pts each (max -20)

**Why it matters:** Indicates optimization opportunities

### 4. Compression Score (20%)
**What it measures:** Estimated compression effectiveness

**Penalties applied for:**
- High average file size (>200KB): -30 pts
- Unoptimized images (avg >500KB): -25 pts
- Large images (avg >200KB): -10 pts

**Why it matters:** Shows if resources are properly minified/compressed

## 🎓 Key Technical Decisions

### Why Weighted Scoring?
Different metrics have varying impacts on real-world performance. Page size affects load time most significantly, hence 30% weight.

### Why These Thresholds?
Based on industry standards and Google Lighthouse recommendations:
- < 500 KB pages load in < 2 seconds on 3G
- < 25 requests minimize connection overhead
- Balanced resources prevent bottlenecks

### Why Client-Side Calculation?
- No server required
- Instant feedback
- Privacy-friendly (no data sent)
- Works offline

### Why Color-Coded?
- Visual at-a-glance understanding
- Matches user expectations (green=good, red=bad)
- Accessible and intuitive
