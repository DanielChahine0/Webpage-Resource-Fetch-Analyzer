# ✅ GitHub Pages Deployment Checklist

Follow this checklist step-by-step to deploy your application.

## Before You Start

- [ ] Code is committed locally
- [ ] You have a GitHub account
- [ ] Repository exists on GitHub: `DanielChahine0/Webpage-Resource-Fetch-Analyzer`

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (CRITICAL!)

- [ ] Go to: https://github.com/DanielChahine0/Webpage-Resource-Fetch-Analyzer
- [ ] Click **Settings** tab (top menu)
- [ ] Click **Pages** in left sidebar (under "Code and automation")
- [ ] Under "Build and deployment":
  - [ ] Find **Source** dropdown
  - [ ] Select **GitHub Actions** (NOT "Deploy from branch")
  - [ ] Click **Save** if a save button appears
- [ ] You should see: "GitHub Actions" selected

**⚠️ This is the most important step! Without this, deployment will fail.**

---

### Step 2: Verify Actions Permissions

- [ ] Still in Settings, click **Actions** → **General** (left sidebar)
- [ ] Scroll to "Workflow permissions"
- [ ] Ensure **"Read and write permissions"** is selected
- [ ] Check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
- [ ] Click **Save** at the bottom

---

### Step 3: Push Your Code

Open PowerShell in your project directory and run:

```powershell
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Enable GitHub Pages deployment"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

- [ ] Commands executed without errors
- [ ] Refresh GitHub repository page to confirm push

---

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment

- [ ] Go to **Actions** tab on GitHub
- [ ] You should see a workflow run: "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
- [ ] Click on the workflow run to see details
- [ ] Wait for all steps to complete (1-3 minutes)
- [ ] Look for green checkmarks ✅

**If you see an error**: Read the error message, it usually tells you what's wrong.

---

### Step 5: Verify Your Site

- [ ] Go back to Settings → Pages
- [ ] You should see: "Your site is live at https://danielchahine0.github.io/Webpage-Resource-Fetch-Analyzer/"
- [ ] Click the URL or copy and paste into browser
- [ ] Test the analyzer with a URL (e.g., "https://example.com")
- [ ] Verify everything works correctly

---

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
- ✅ Actions tab shows green checkmark
- ✅ Settings → Pages shows "Your site is live at..."
- ✅ Site loads in browser
- ✅ Analyzer functionality works

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:

**Error: "Get Pages site failed"**
- ✅ Fix: Go to Settings → Pages → Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
- Then push another commit to retry

**Error: "Permission denied"**
- ✅ Fix: Go to Settings → Actions → General → Set "Read and write permissions"
- Then re-run the workflow

**Site shows 404**
- ✅ Wait 5 minutes for DNS propagation
- ✅ Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
- ✅ Verify deployment succeeded in Actions tab

**Workflow doesn't run**
- ✅ Check that Actions are enabled: Settings → Actions → General
- ✅ Make sure you pushed to the `main` branch
- ✅ Manually trigger: Actions → Deploy to GitHub Pages → Run workflow
