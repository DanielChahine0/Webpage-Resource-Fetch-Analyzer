| 📥 | Fetching resource | Individual resource fetch |
| 🎯 | Direct fetch | Direct fetch attempts |
| 🔄 | Proxy fallback | Proxy service usage |
| 💾 | Cache hit | Cached data retrieved |
| ✅ | Success | Successful operations |
| ⏳ | Rate limiting | Request delays |
| ⚠️ | Warning | Retry attempts |
| ❌ | Error | Failed operations |
| 📊 | Summary | Analysis statistics |

## How to Use

1. **Open DevTools**: Press F12 in your browser
2. **Navigate to Console**: Click the Console tab
3. **Run Analysis**: Analyze any URL
4. **Watch Logs**: See real-time progress

## Filtering Logs

Use DevTools console filter to focus on specific events:
- `✅` - Only successes
- `⚠️` - Only warnings
- `❌` - Only errors
- `Cache` - Cache operations only
- `Rate limiting` - Rate limit delays only

## Implementation

The logging system is implemented in:
- `src/js/utils/logger.js` - Centralized logger utility
- `src/js/core/resource-fetcher.js` - Fetch operations logging
- `src/js/core/resource-analyzer.js` - Analysis lifecycle logging

Logging can be disabled in production by setting `isDevelopment = false` in `logger.js`.
