# Load Time Estimation Feature

## Overview
The Load Time Estimation feature provides detailed predictions of how long a webpage will take to load under different network conditions. This helps developers understand their site's performance across various connection types and optimize accordingly.

## Features

### Network Profiles
The estimator includes 5 common network connection types:

1. **3G Mobile** 📱
   - Download Speed: 0.75 Mbps (750 Kbps)
   - Latency: 100ms
   - Max Parallel Connections: 6

2. **4G/LTE** 📶
   - Download Speed: 10 Mbps
   - Latency: 50ms
   - Max Parallel Connections: 6

3. **5G** 🚀
   - Download Speed: 100 Mbps
   - Latency: 10ms
   - Max Parallel Connections: 10

4. **WiFi** 📡
   - Download Speed: 50 Mbps
   - Latency: 20ms
   - Max Parallel Connections: 8

5. **Cable/Fiber** ⚡
   - Download Speed: 200 Mbps
   - Latency: 10ms
   - Max Parallel Connections: 10

## Calculation Methodology

### Load Time Components

The total load time is broken down into three main components:

#### 1. Network Latency
- **Initial Latency**: DNS lookup + TCP handshake + TLS handshake (3x base latency)
- **Additional Latency**: Latency for each batch of parallel downloads
- Formula: `initialLatency + (latency × (batchCount - 1))`

#### 2. Download Time
- Calculated using parallel connection simulation
- Resources are sorted by size (largest first)
- Downloads are distributed across available connections
- Formula: Time for the slowest connection queue to complete
- Takes into account:
  - Resource sizes
  - Download speed (converted to bytes/ms)
  - Maximum parallel connections

#### 3. Parse & Render Time
Estimated based on resource types and sizes:
- **HTML**: ~0.5ms per KB
- **CSS**: ~0.3ms per KB + 50ms for render tree
- **JavaScript**: ~1ms per KB (parsing + execution)
- **Images**: ~0.1ms per KB (decoding)
- **Other resources**: ~0.05ms per KB
- **Base render time**: 100ms (layout, paint, composite)

### Speed Categories

Load times are categorized for easy understanding:

| Time Range | Category | Icon | Color |
|------------|----------|------|-------|
| < 1s | Excellent | ⚡ | Green |
| 1s - 2.5s | Good | ✓ | Blue |
| 2.5s - 5s | Fair | ⚠️ | Orange |
| 5s - 10s | Slow | 🐌 | Red |
| > 10s | Very Slow | 🚨 | Dark Red |

## Visual Display

### Network Cards
Each network type is displayed in its own card showing:
- Network icon and name
- Download speed
- Total estimated load time
- Speed category badge
- Visual breakdown bar (latency/download/parse)
- Detailed timing breakdown
- Resource count
- Parallel connection count

### Interactive Features
- **Hover Effects**: Cards lift on hover for better UX
- **Tooltips**: Breakdown segments show exact times on hover
- **Color Coding**: Consistent color scheme for timing components
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens

## Technical Implementation

### Core Files

1. **`src/js/core/load-time-estimator.js`**
   - Main calculation engine
   - Network profile definitions
   - Parallel download simulation
   - Time formatting utilities

2. **`src/js/ui/load-time-display.js`**
   - UI rendering logic
   - HTML generation
   - Display management

3. **`src/css/load-time.css`**
   - Complete styling for load time cards
   - Responsive design rules
   - Animation and hover effects

### Integration Points

The feature integrates with:
- **UI Controller**: Calls `LoadTimeDisplay.display()` after analysis
- **CSV Exporter**: Includes load time data in exported files
- **Results Display**: Clears estimates when clearing results

### Usage in Code

```javascript
import { LoadTimeEstimator } from './core/load-time-estimator.js';
import { LoadTimeDisplay } from './ui/load-time-display.js';

// Calculate estimates
const estimates = LoadTimeEstimator.estimateLoadTimes(resources);

// Display in UI
LoadTimeDisplay.display(resources);

// Format individual times
const formattedTime = LoadTimeEstimator.formatTime(milliseconds);

// Get speed category
const category = LoadTimeEstimator.getSpeedCategory(milliseconds);
```

## CSV Export

Load time estimates are automatically included in CSV exports with the following format:

```csv
Load Time Estimates
Network Type,Download Speed (Mbps),Latency (ms),Download Time,Parse/Render Time,Total Time
3G,0.75,100,2.5s,850ms,3.35s
4G/LTE,10,50,750ms,850ms,1.6s
...
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Lightweight Calculations**: All calculations are performed client-side with minimal overhead
- **Efficient Sorting**: Uses native JavaScript sort for resource prioritization
- **Minimal DOM Manipulation**: Single innerHTML update per render
- **CSS-based Animations**: Smooth transitions without JavaScript

## Accuracy Notes

The estimates are based on ideal network conditions and may differ from real-world performance due to:
- Server response times and processing
- CDN performance and geographic location
- Browser caching
- Network congestion and packet loss
- JavaScript execution complexity
- Third-party scripts and APIs
- Image optimization and compression
- HTTP/2 multiplexing effects

The estimates serve as a **baseline comparison tool** rather than precise predictions.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Custom network profile creation
2. HTTP/2 vs HTTP/1.1 comparison
3. Progressive rendering simulation
4. Cache impact simulation
5. Resource priority and critical path analysis
6. Server-side rendering time estimation
7. Third-party script impact analysis
8. Compression ratio estimation
9. Historical performance tracking
10. A/B comparison between different configurations

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

Uses standard ES6+ features with no dependencies on external libraries.

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast color schemes
- Responsive text sizing

## Testing

To test the feature:
1. Analyze any webpage using the tool
2. Scroll to the "Estimated Load Times" section
3. Review estimates for each network type
4. Hover over breakdown bars for details
5. Export CSV to verify data inclusion
