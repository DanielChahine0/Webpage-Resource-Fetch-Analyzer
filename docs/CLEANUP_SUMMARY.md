# 🧹 Project Cleanup Summary

## Date: October 13, 2025

### Files Removed ❌

The following monolithic files were removed as they've been replaced by the modular structure:

1. **`index-new.html`** → Renamed to `index.html` ✅
2. **`script.js`** (874 lines) → Replaced by 13 modular JS files in `src/js/`
3. **`styles.css`** (562 lines) → Replaced by 9 modular CSS files in `src/css/`

### Current Project Structure ✅

### Benefits of Cleanup 🎯

✅ **Cleaner Root Directory**
- Only essential files in root
- Better organization with `src/` and `docs/` folders

✅ **No Duplicate Code**
- Removed old monolithic versions
- Single source of truth for all code

✅ **Better Maintainability**
- Modular structure is easier to navigate
- Each file has a single responsibility

✅ **Improved Developer Experience**
- Clear folder structure
- ES6 modules for better tooling support

✅ **Smaller File Sizes**
- Individual modules are easier to read
- Better for version control (cleaner diffs)

### Migration Notes 📝

**Before Cleanup:**
- Had both old and new versions of files
- Monolithic code (single large files)
- Unclear which version to use

**After Cleanup:**
- Single clean version
- Modular architecture
- Clear project structure
- All documentation organized in `docs/`

### What Was Preserved 💾

All functionality remains identical:
- Performance score calculator
- Resource analysis
- CSV export
- Progress tracking
- Error handling
- All UI components

### Next Steps 🚀

1. ✅ Test `index.html` in browser
2. ✅ Verify all features work correctly
3. ✅ Review documentation in `docs/` folder
4. 📦 Consider adding a build system (optional)
5. 🧪 Add unit tests (future enhancement)

**Result:** Clean, professional project structure with no unnecessary files! 🎉
