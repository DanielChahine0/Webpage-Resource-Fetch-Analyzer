# Bug Fix: Performance Score Not Displaying

## Issue
The performance score was not displaying after analysis because the `displayPerformanceScore()` function was never being called.

## Root Cause
In the `handleAnalyze()` function, after the analysis completed:
- The results were stored: `this.results = results;`
- **BUT** the `displayPerformanceScore()` function was never called
- This meant the performance score calculation happened but was never rendered to the UI

## Solution
Added the missing call to display the performance score:

```javascript
// Store results and display performance score
this.results = results;
this.displayPerformanceScore(this.analyzer.calculatePerformanceScore(results));
this.showProgress(false);
```

## What Changed
**Before:**
```javascript
);

this.results = results;
this.showProgress(false);
```

**After:**
```javascript
);

// Store results and display performance score
this.results = results;
this.displayPerformanceScore(this.analyzer.calculatePerformanceScore(results));
this.showProgress(false);
```

## Testing Instructions
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Enter a URL (e.g., `example.com`)
3. Click "Analyze"
4. After analysis completes, you should now see:
   - ⚡ Performance Score card at the top of results
   - A circular score indicator (0-100)
   - Color-coded by performance level
   - Info button (ℹ️) to view detailed breakdown

## Expected Behavior
After the fix, the performance score will:
- ✅ Display immediately after analysis completes
- ✅ Show the correct score (0-100)
- ✅ Be color-coded (green/orange/red)
- ✅ Include expandable breakdown when clicking ℹ️

## File Modified
- `script.js` - Line ~830

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Performance score will now display correctly after analysis.
