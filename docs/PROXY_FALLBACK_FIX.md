# Proxy Fallback Fix

## Problem
The application was failing with CORS errors and 500 Internal Server Error when trying to fetch resources from GitHub using the AllOrigins RAW proxy endpoint:

```
Access to fetch at 'https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=...' has been blocked by CORS policy
GET https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=... net::ERR_FAILED 500 (Internal Server Error)
```

## Solution
Implemented a **multi-proxy fallback system** with automatic retry and proxy switching.

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Resource Fetcher (`src/js/core/resource-fetcher.js`)**
- Added multiple proxy options with fallback mechanism:
  - **CORS Anywhere (Heroku)** - Requires user request for access
  - **AllOrigins GET** - More reliable, returns JSON with contents
  - **AllOrigins RAW** - Original proxy (kept as fallback)
  - **ThingProxy** - Alternative free CORS proxy

- Enhanced `fetchHTML()` method:
  - Tries each proxy sequentially until one succeeds
  - Remembers the successful proxy for future requests
  - Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting
  - Handles different response formats (JSON vs raw text)

- Enhanced `fetchResourceSize()` method:
  - Automatically switches to next proxy on failure
  - Maintains rate limiting per proxy
  - Better error handling and retry logic

- Added utility methods:
  - `getCurrentProxy()` - Get current working proxy information
  - `switchProxy()` - Manually switch to next proxy

#### 2. **UI Enhancements**

**HTML (`index.html`)**
- Added proxy status indicator in the progress section
- Displays which proxy service is currently being used

**CSS (`src/css/progress.css`)**
- Styled the proxy status indicator to match the app's design
- Uses blue accent color for visibility

**Progress Display (`src/js/ui/progress-display.js`)**
- Added `updateProxyStatus()` method to show/hide proxy information
- Displays current proxy name during analysis

**UI Controller (`src/js/ui/ui-controller.js`)**
- Integrated proxy status display in the analysis workflow
- Shows proxy information as soon as analysis starts

### How It Works

1. **Initial Request**: Starts with AllOrigins GET (index 1) which is more reliable than RAW
2. **Automatic Fallback**: If a proxy fails (CORS, 500 error, timeout), automatically tries the next one
3. **Proxy Persistence**: Once a proxy succeeds, it's remembered for subsequent requests
4. **User Visibility**: Users can see which proxy is being used in real-time

### Proxy Priority Order

1. **AllOrigins GET** (Default) - Most reliable for most websites
2. **AllOrigins RAW** - Fallback option
3. **ThingProxy** - Alternative free service
4. **CORS Anywhere** - Requires manual access request at https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/

### Testing

### Benefits

✅ **Resilient**: No single point of failure
✅ **Transparent**: Users see which proxy is being used
✅ **Automatic**: No user intervention required for switching
✅ **Logged**: Detailed console logs for debugging
✅ **Fast**: Remembers successful proxy to avoid unnecessary retries

### Future Improvements

- Add ability for users to manually select/switch proxies via UI
- Implement proxy health checking before attempting requests
- Add option to configure custom proxy URLs
- Store successful proxy preference in localStorage
