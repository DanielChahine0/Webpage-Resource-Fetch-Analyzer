# Proxy Service Troubleshooting

## 🔴 Common Issue: "All proxy services failed"

This error occurs when all CORS proxy services fail to fetch the requested URL. Here's what's happening and how to fix it.

## 🔍 Why This Happens

Free CORS proxy services are **unreliable** and frequently experience:
- **Service outages** - Proxies go down temporarily
- **Rate limiting** - Too many requests from users
- **DNS issues** - Proxy domains can't be resolved
- **CORS restrictions** - Even proxies can be blocked
- **Website blocking** - Target sites block known proxy IPs

## ✅ Updated Proxy List (Priority Order)

The app now tries these proxies in order:

1. **CORS Proxy** (corsproxy.io) - NEW, most reliable
2. **CORS.SH** - NEW, fast alternative
3. **AllOrigins GET** - Reliable, JSON response
4. **AllOrigins RAW** - Original option
5. **Proxy.CORS.SH** - NEW, backup option
6. **API CORS Proxy** (codetabs.com) - NEW addition
7. **ThingProxy** - Often down, but worth trying
8. **CORS Anywhere** - Requires manual access request

## 🧪 Testing URLs

Some URLs work better than others. Try these:

### ✅ Usually Work:
```
https://example.com
https://httpbin.org/html
https://www.wikipedia.org
http://info.cern.ch (first website ever)
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
```

### ⚠️ May Have Issues:
```
https://github.com (heavy anti-bot protection)
https://google.com (blocks most proxies)
https://facebook.com (strict CORS policies)
https://twitter.com (API restrictions)
```

### 🎯 Best for Testing:
```
https://example.com - Lightweight, fast
https://www.wikipedia.org - Lots of resources
https://httpbin.org/html - Made for testing
```

## 🔧 Solutions

### Solution 1: Wait and Retry (Simplest)
1. Wait **2-5 minutes**
2. Try again
3. Proxies often recover quickly

### Solution 2: Try Different URLs
Some websites are easier to fetch than others. Start with `https://example.com`

### Solution 3: Check Your Internet
- Verify you're connected to internet
- Try opening the URL directly in your browser
- Check if your network has firewall restrictions

### Solution 4: Use Browser Console
Open DevTools (F12) and check:
- Which proxies are being tried
- What specific errors are occurring
- Network tab shows actual requests

### Solution 5: Clear Cache
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click Refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
4. Or use the app's built-in cache clear

### Solution 6: Enable CORS Anywhere (Advanced)
If you see "403 Forbidden" for CORS Anywhere:

1. Visit: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo
2. Click "Request temporary access to the demo server"
3. Try your request again within 2 hours

## 📊 What the Error Means

### Error Patterns:

**"Failed to fetch"**
- Network connectivity issue
- Proxy is completely down
- DNS can't resolve proxy domain

**"403 Forbidden"**
- Proxy requires authentication
- Rate limit exceeded
- Target website blocking proxy IP

**"404 Not Found"**
- Proxy service endpoint changed
- Invalid proxy URL configuration

**"CORS policy"**
- Browser blocking the request
- Proxy not setting CORS headers properly

**"net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED"**
- DNS can't find proxy domain
- Proxy service is permanently down
- Network blocking DNS lookups

**"Timeout (15s)"**
- Request took too long
- Proxy is overloaded
- Target website is very slow

## 🚀 Quick Fix Checklist

Try these in order:

1. ✅ **Use `https://example.com` first** - Simplest test
2. ✅ **Wait 2 minutes and retry** - Proxies may recover
3. ✅ **Check browser console (F12)** - See which proxy works
4. ✅ **Try different URL** - Some sites are easier
5. ✅ **Clear browser cache** - Force fresh requests
6. ✅ **Check internet connection** - Basic connectivity
7. ✅ **Try different browser** - Rule out browser issues
8. ✅ **Wait longer (5-10 min)** - Service may be restarting

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Developers:
- The app automatically tries **8 different proxies**
- Each has a **15-second timeout**
- Successful proxy is **remembered** for next requests
- Check console logs to see which proxies are being tried

### For Users:
- **Simple URLs work best** (example.com, wikipedia.org)
- **Heavy sites may fail** (github.com, google.com)
- **Retry after a few minutes** if all fail
- **Check console logs** (F12) for details

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Planned enhancements:
- [ ] Add user option to select specific proxy
- [ ] Implement proxy health check before use
- [ ] Add "retry with different proxy" button
- [ ] Store working proxy preference in localStorage
- [ ] Add proxy status indicator showing health
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for retries
- [ ] Add option to use custom proxy URL

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

1. **Check the browser console** (F12) for specific errors
2. **Try the simplest URL first**: `https://example.com`
3. **Wait 5 minutes** and try again
4. **Try a different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
5. **Check if your network has firewall restrictions**

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Normal Operation:
```
🌐 Fetching main HTML from: https://example.com
🔄 Trying CORS Proxy...
✅ HTML fetched successfully using CORS Proxy (1.23 KB)
```

### When Proxy Fails (Normal):
```
🔄 Trying AllOrigins GET...
⚠️ AllOrigins GET failed: 500 Internal Server Error
🔄 Trying AllOrigins RAW...
✅ HTML fetched successfully using AllOrigins RAW (1.23 KB)
```

### Complete Failure (All Proxies Down):
```
🔄 Trying CORS Proxy...
❌ CORS Proxy error: Failed to fetch
🔄 Trying CORS.SH...
❌ CORS.SH error: Timeout (15s)
... (tries all 8 proxies)
❌ Error: All proxy services failed...
```

## 📝 Summary

**The app now has 8 different proxy services**. If one fails, it automatically tries the next one. Most failures are **temporary** and can be resolved by:
1. Waiting a few minutes
2. Trying a simpler URL like `example.com`
3. Checking your internet connection

The new proxies (CORS Proxy, CORS.SH, etc.) are generally more reliable than the old ones!
