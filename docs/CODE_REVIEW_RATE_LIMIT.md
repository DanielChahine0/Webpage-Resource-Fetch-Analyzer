# Code Review Checklist - Rate Limit Fix

## âœ… Syntax Errors
- [x] No syntax errors in resource-fetcher.js
- [x] No syntax errors in resource-analyzer.js
- [x] No syntax errors in app.js
- [x] No syntax errors in index.html
- [x] All other JS files clean

## âœ… Logic Flow
1. **Rate Limiting Implementation**
   - [x] `addDelay()` properly calculates time since last request
   - [x] Uses `Date.now()` for timestamps
   - [x] Properly awaits delay promises
   - [x] HTML fetch uses 200ms delay (longer)
   - [x] Resource fetch uses 100ms delay

2. **Direct Fetch Strategy**
   - [x] `tryDirectFetch()` attempts HEAD request first
   - [x] Properly handles AbortController timeout
   - [x] Returns null on failure (no error thrown)
   - [x] Parses content-length header correctly
   - [x] Falls back to proxy when direct fails

3. **Retry Logic**
   - [x] Retry loop properly handles up to 2 retries (0, 1, 2 = 3 attempts)
   - [x] 429 errors trigger exponential backoff
   - [x] Backoff formula: `1000 * 2^attempt`, capped at 5000ms
   - [x] Other errors use linear backoff: 500ms * (attempt + 1)
   - [x] `continue` statement properly restarts loop
   - [x] Final failures cache as 0

4. **Caching**
   - [x] Checks cache before any fetch
   - [x] Caches successful direct fetches
   - [x] Caches successful proxy fetches
   - [x] Caches failures as 0
   - [x] Returns cached value immediately

5. **Concurrency Control**
   - [x] Default concurrency reduced to 3
   - [x] Batch size reduced to 5 in resource-analyzer
   - [x] Promise pool properly managed
   - [x] Uses Promise.race for concurrency limit

## âœ… Edge Cases
- [x] Handles AbortError (timeout)
- [x] Handles 429 (rate limit)
- [x] Handles network errors
- [x] Handles missing content-length header
- [x] Handles CORS failures gracefully
- [x] Handles empty URL lists
- [x] Handles duplicate URLs (via cache)

## âœ… Performance Considerations
- [x] Direct fetch tried first (faster, no rate limits)
- [x] Reduced concurrency prevents overwhelming proxy
- [x] Delays prevent rate limiting
- [x] Caching prevents duplicate requests
- [x] Progressive UI updates maintained

## ðŸ§ª Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Small Website (< 20 resources)
- Expected: Should complete without errors
- Expected: Some resources may use direct fetch
- Expected: Overall time: ~5-10 seconds

### Test 2: Medium Website (20-50 resources)
- Expected: Should complete with minimal errors
- Expected: May see occasional retry messages
- Expected: Overall time: ~15-30 seconds

### Test 3: Large Website (> 50 resources)
- Expected: Should complete with few failures
- Expected: Will see retry messages for rate limits
- Expected: Overall time: ~30-60 seconds

### Test 4: Rapid Repeated Requests
- Try analyzing the same URL multiple times
- Expected: Second+ runs should be faster (caching)
- Expected: No rate limit errors on cached resources

## ðŸ“Š Expected Console Output

### Good Request
```
(No output - silent success)
```

### Rate Limited (with retry)
```
Rate limited for https://example.com/image.jpg, retrying in 1000ms...
```

### Failed After Retries
```
Failed to fetch https://example.com/missing.jpg (attempt 1/3): Not Found
Failed to fetch https://example.com/missing.jpg (attempt 2/3): Not Found
Failed to fetch https://example.com/missing.jpg: Not Found
```

### Timeout
```
Timeout fetching https://slow-server.com/image.jpg
```

## âœ… All Checks Passed
No code errors detected. Ready for testing!
