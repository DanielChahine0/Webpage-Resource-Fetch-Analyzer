# Performance Score Feature

## Overview
The Performance Score Calculator provides a comprehensive 0-100 score for analyzed webpages, similar to Google Lighthouse. It helps users quickly assess overall performance quality.

## Score Categories

| Score | Category | Indicator | Meaning |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 90-100 | Excellent | ðŸŸ¢ Green | Outstanding performance |
| 75-89 | Good | ðŸŸ  Orange | Good performance, minor improvements possible |
| 50-74 | Fair | ðŸŸ§ Dark Orange | Moderate performance, improvements recommended |
| 0-49 | Poor | ðŸ”´ Red | Significant performance issues |

## Scoring Metrics

The score is calculated using 4 weighted metrics:

### 1. Page Size Score (30% weight)
Evaluates total page size in MB:
- **Excellent**: < 500 KB
- **Good**: 500 KB - 1 MB
- **Fair**: 1 MB - 2 MB
- **Poor**: > 2 MB

### 2. Request Count Score (25% weight)
Evaluates total HTTP requests:
- **Excellent**: < 25 requests
- **Good**: 25-50 requests
- **Fair**: 50-100 requests
- **Poor**: > 100 requests

### 3. Resource Distribution Score (25% weight)
Checks for balanced resource distribution. Penalties for:
- Image-heavy pages (> 70% of total size)
- Excessive JavaScript (> 50% of total size)
- Too much CSS (> 30% of total size)
- Large individual files (> 500 KB each)

### 4. Compression/Optimization Score (20% weight)
Estimates compression effectiveness. Penalties for:
- High average file size (> 200 KB suggests poor compression)
- Unoptimized images (average image size > 500 KB)
